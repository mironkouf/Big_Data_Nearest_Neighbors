# big_data_nearest_neighbors
In order to run the project we have to download the zip file to get the datasets. This project implements the Jaccard similarity and the Signature similarity for the registrations. Moreover, we calculate average similarities with Brute force and the LSH algorithm. Our goal is to see the difference between those methods.
